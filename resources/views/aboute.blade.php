                <h2>About cryptocurrencies</h2>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    Cryptocurrencies are digital assets used as a tool for investment and (less often) payment for
                    goods and services. Digital assets are purchased with real money: for example, in exchange for
                    dollars or euros.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    There are quite a lot of them: the most famous Bitcoin, the popular Ethereum, EOS or Ripple.
                    These technologies have become so popular that even Facebook has taken up the creation of
                    the Libra cryptocurrency project.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    Despite the fact that cryptocurrencies as a phenomenon appeared more than 10 years ago, they
                    are gaining real popularity only now. In particular, thanks to some technical features:
                </p>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    1. Decentralization. Unlike traditional banking systems, cryptocurrencies are not regulated by a
                    single governing body.
                    2. Anonymity. The possibility of more confidential payments is another advantage that provides
                    demand for currencies.
                    3. Speed of operation. The high speed of transaction processing, the simplicity of their
                    implementation and versatility also cannot but attract attention.

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    Moreover, such payment systems are characterized by a higher level of security.

                <h2>Investing in cryptocurrencies</h2>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    A couple of years ago, the cryptocurrency investment industry was not taken seriously. In 2017,
                    Bitcoin reached its maximum historical value and significantly lost in price due to the
                    unpreparedness of investors and a number of additional factors.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    In 2020, the cryptocurrency was reanimated. The development of the legislative framework, the
                    interest from large corporations and institutional investors did their job, and the market
                    capitalization began to grow. At some point, Bitcoin was compared to gold.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    By the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, the historical maximum was updated and
                    exceeded the previous one almost twice: 1 Bitcoin was sold at a price of more than 40,000 USD.
                    After a minor correction, the asset value slightly decreased and became more stable.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    Everything suggests that the industry will continue to develop: the trust funds of Harvard and
                    Yale invested in bitcoin, the purchase of this cryptocurrency has become more popular than
                    transactions with technology stocks, according to a report by Bank of America.
                </p>

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    That is why we consider cryptocurrencies as an investment tool with great prospects and it is
                    for this reason that our partners receive a high percentage of income: the market is in demand
                    and volatile, you can make great money on it.

                    You do not need specific knowledge and experience of trading in financial markets. In order to
                    make the investment available to everyone, we have created affordable pricing plans with an
                    entry threshold of $ 100 and $ 500.

                <p class="aboutUsPageContent">
                    All you have to do is study and choose an investment plan, top up your deposit and expect your
                    profit. The funds received can be reinvested to increase income.
